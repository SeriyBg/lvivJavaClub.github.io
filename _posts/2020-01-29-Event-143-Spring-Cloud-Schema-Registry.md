This week on Java club we will take a look at Spring Cloud Schema Registry that provides support for schema evolution so that the data can be evolved over time and still work with older or newer producers and consumers and vice versa.[https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-schema-registry](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-schema-registry)

Join us next Thursday, at 10:00 in Jamaica (room 223)
