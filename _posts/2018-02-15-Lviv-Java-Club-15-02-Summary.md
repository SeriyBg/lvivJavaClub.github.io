Hi, this week on Java club
we continued playing with Spring 5 features. We switched our app to MongoDB, introduced reactive repository and (almost) added HTML page with list of users using reactive WebSockets. See repository `spring5` on GitHub [https://http://bit.ly/2q0nl8w](https://http://bit.ly/2q0nl8w)

Join us next Thursday, at 10:00 in Jamaica (room 223)
